    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There are 40 circular boxes.</li>
      <li>A random number between 1 and 40 is generated.</li>
      <li>You have 6 attempts to guess the correct number.</li>
      <li>
        If your guess is too low, the circle turns yellow, and if it's too high,
        it turns red.

        If you guess correctly, the circle turns green, and the game ends.
